# VGU Teaching Bot
- A software project for the "Fundamentals of Telecommunication" module.
- Used a Python library - discord.py - to create a bot to create an online teaching platform based on Discord.
- Teachers could easily manage students (kick, mute, ban), invite them to the classroom (video call), check attendances, public multiple choices questions to a class, and add bad words to restrict in the server via provided commands.
- Students could register and join in a class, answer questions provided by the teacher, interact with other members in the server, and play some idle games via easy-to-use commands.
